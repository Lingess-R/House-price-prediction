# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts house prices based on various features such as location, area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc. The model was trained using a dataset that contains real estate data and serves predictions via a Flask-based web app.

## Project Overview
This machine learning project is designed to predict house prices using a regression model. The web application allows users to input house-related features (like square footage, number of rooms, etc.), and returns the predicted price of the house. 

The main aim of this project is to help users get an estimate of house prices based on various input factors, making it useful for home buyers, real estate agents, or investors.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language used.
- **Flask**: To serve the machine learning model via a web interface.
- **scikit-learn**: For implementing and training the machine learning model (Linear Regression).
- **pandas** and **numpy**: For data processing and manipulation.
- **HTML/CSS**: To build a simple front-end interface.
- **Git**: For version control.


## How to Run Locally:
1. Clone the repository:https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
2. Install the required dependencies:
3. Run the Flask server: python server.py
4. Open your browser and navigate to:http://127.0.0.1:5000/

## Model and Dataset:
- The model uses a Linear Regression model to predict house prices.
- The dataset used is XYZ (mention where the data comes from if applicable).

## Results:
- Achieved an RÂ² score of XX% on the test set.
